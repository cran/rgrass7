Description: Interpreted interface between 'GRASS' 7 geographical 
    information system and R, based on starting R from within the 'GRASS' 'GIS'
    environment, or running free-standing R in a temporary 'GRASS' location;
    the package provides facilities for using all 'GRASS' commands from the 
    R command line. This package may not be used for 'GRASS' 6, for which
    'spgrass6' should be used.

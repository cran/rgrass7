	* Introduced several tryCatch() to delete files after error
	  
	  * based on
	  http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.grass.stats/26
	  similar potential problems were identified and code encapsulated
	  in
	  tryCatch blocks.

	* Fixed Bug
	  http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gis.grass.stats/26
	  
	  * temporary files were not deleted upon error.
	  Wrapped tryCatch block around code.

2015-01-28 14:16  rkrug

	* Added blocing for spgrass6 and spgrass7 unless correct GRASS GIS
	  version used
	  
	  * spgrass6, spgrass: added two internal functions:
	  .grassVersion(): returns GRASS GIS version used
	  .compatibleGRASSVersion(gv=.grassVersion()): returns TRUE if
	  GRASS GIS version
	  is compatible, FALSE if not. As an attribute, it returns an error
	  / status
	  message which can be printed.
	  
	  * spgrass6/AAA.R, spgrass7/AAA.R: added check for
	  .compatibleGRASSVersion() in .onAttach()
	  which raises error if GRASS GIS version is not compatible. The
	  result is that the
	  package can not be loaded in R when running in an incompatible
	  GRASS GIS version.
	  
	  * spgrass6/initGRASS.R, spgrass7/initGRASS.R: added check for
	  .compatibleGRASSVersion()
	  which raises error if GRASS GIS version is not compatible and
	  aborts initGRASS().

	* update man pages arguments to match code (running R CMD check)

2015-01-27 12:21  rsbivand

	* change name from spgrass to spgrass7

2015-01-27 11:30  rkrug

	* Refactorng of code from readVect and writeVect
	  
	  * introduced internal functions .read_vect_plugin and
	  .read_vect_non_plugin for actual reading and writing of vector
	  * moved reading of options from code into default values
	  (ignore.stderr, plugin, useGDAL)
	  * wrapped code in tryCatch to reset echoCmdOption

2015-01-27 11:07  rkrug

	* Summary: Fixed renaming error and added . to internal functions
	  
	  * fixed renamin=g error of read_rast_... functions
	  * added . to function names read_rast_plugin and
	  .read_rast_non_plugin

2015-01-27 10:36  rkrug

	* Summary: Rename internal functions to implement
	  
	  * renamed
	  read_plugin -->> read_rast_plugin
	  read_bin -->> read_rast_nonplugin
	  To have consistent naming scheme for reading vectors

2015-01-27 10:26  rkrug

	* Streamlining of code
	  
	  * readRAST, writeRAST: changed default values in function
	  definitions
	  of ignore.stderr, plugin and useGDAL from NULL to the values
	  obtained by get....Option()
	  
	  * Moved closeAllConnections code outsude the try block to ensure
	  that opened connections are closed

2015-01-27 10:00  rkrug

	* Summary: Setting of echoCmdOption fixed
	  
	  * readRAST: the resetting of echoCmdOption was only done if
	  return_SGDF was TRUE. Moved resetting to end of function call and
	  wrapped into tryCatch() block to reset echoCmdOOption even in
	  case of error.
	  
	  * writeRAST: Wrapped into tryCatch() block to reset
	  echoCmdOOption even in case of error.

2015-01-26 14:58  rkrug

	* Summary: Move reading of raster non-plugin into extra function
	  
	  * created new internal function read_bin() which reads the
	  raster, equivalent to read_plugin()

	* Spring cleaning for GRASS GIS 7
	  
	  * remove references and code opnly used for grass 6
	  * removed check for grass 7
